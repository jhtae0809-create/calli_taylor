Taylor the educator / Secretary Kim / AI Voice Coaching Agent

> **Real-time English conversation coach designed for Business & Travel scenarios.**
> *Built with Vapi, OpenAI Realtime API, and Python.*

## 💡 Overview
**Calli** is a voice-first AI agent aimed at helping non-native speakers practice English in realistic scenarios. Unlike traditional text-based bots, Calli focuses on **latency, natural interruption, and scenario-based roleplay** using the latest Voice AI technology.

This project was developed as a **Rapid Prototype** to solve a personal pain point: the lack of accessible, real-time speaking practice partners.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Real-time Voice Interaction:** Utilizes **OpenAI RealtimeAPI** to minimize latency, creating a natural "human-like" conversation flow.
- **Scenario-Based Coaching:** Supports 15+ roleplay scenarios including *Business Negotiation, Hotel Check-in,* and *Casual Small Talk*.
- **Noise Robustness:** Implemented input logic to filter background noise and prevent accidental interruptions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Voice Infrastructure:** Realtime API
- **Language:** Python (AsyncIO, WebSockets)

## 📂 Project Structure
- 

## 🎯 How It Works
1. The user selects a scenario (e.g., "Salary Negotiation").
2. Calli initiates the conversation with a scenario-specific opening.
3. As the user speaks, Vapi processes the audio stream and triggers the LLM.
4. Calli responds with corrected grammar suggestions and natural dialogue.

## 🔜 Future Improvements
- Add a dashboard to visualize "Grammar Accuracy" over time.
- Implement more detailed feedback reports after each session.
